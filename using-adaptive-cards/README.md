# Using Adaptive Cards

Bot Framework v4 using adaptive cards bot sample.

## To try this sample
- From the root of this project folder:
    - Build the sample using `mvn package`
    - Run it by using `java -jar .\target\using-adaptive-cards.jar`

## Testing the bot using Bot Framework Emulator

[Bot Framework Emulator](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-emulator) is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.

- Install the latest Bot Framework Emulator from [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/releases)

## Connect to the bot using Bot Framework Emulator
- Launch Bot Framework Emulator
- File -> Open Bot
- Enter a Bot URL of `http://localhost:8080/api/messages`
  Card authors describe their content as a simple JSON object. That content can then be rendered natively inside a host application, automatically adapting to the look and feel of the host. For example, Contoso Bot can author an Adaptive Card through the Bot Framework, and when delivered to Cortana, it will look and feel like a Cortana card. When that same payload is sent to Microsoft Teams, it will look and feel like Microsoft Teams. As more host apps start to support Adaptive Cards, that same payload will automatically light up inside these applications, yet still feel entirely native to the app. Users win because everything feels familiar. Host apps win because they control the user experience. Card authors win because their content gets broader reach without any additional work.

The Bot Framework provides support for Adaptive Cards.  See the following to learn more about Adaptive Cards.

### Adding media to messages

A message exchange between user and bot can contain media attachments, such as cards, images, video, audio, and files.
